### ü§ì About me

Since I was born, there has always been a computer at home. That's why I've **spent my life playing around with tech stuff**. When the Internet reached my home, I started to investigate how websites worked. Years later, I **founded a startup, where I started to see technology from a business perspective**. Thanks to MOOCs, but mainly thanks to [**42 Madrid**](https://www.42madrid.com/), I've learnt not only about numerous specific technologies but also the **fundaments of software development** with low level languages such as C and C++.
